<h1>The Best Movies Accoring to RYAN</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Beautiful movie with a star studded cast, incredible visuals, and a story that never gets old.</p>

<h3>Armageddon</h3>
<p>I cry everytime at the end, the cast is incredible, and it is so over the top dumb that it is actually good.</p>

<h3>Independence Day</h3>
<p>Will Smith's best acting, a fun story.</p>
